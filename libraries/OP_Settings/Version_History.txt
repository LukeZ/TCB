00.90.22        01/11/2017 - IMPORTANT NOTE: This release requires an OP Config 00.90.22
                           - IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes in this release will cause all EEPROM settings to be reverted to default after the firmware is flashed. It is advised 
                             to save an OPZ file of your settings before re-flashing. 
                           - Fixed bug with radio detect routine when being run from within OP_PCComm (sketches timer was not being updated)
                           - Adjusted timing of radio detection to make it feasible to test for all three protocols within the 1 second alloted by OP Config
                           - Adjusted number of frames thrown out for iBus when streaming data to the PC in order not to overload OP Config, iBus is an even 
                             worse case than SBus due to the slightly higher baud rate. Now we keep only 1 out of every 3 frames when streaming to OP Config, but
                             in normal operation we keep every other, same as SBus. Also made it easy to adjust these parameters for both SBus and iBus, there is
                             a distinct setting now for the number of frames discarded during normal operation and the number discarded during streaming to the PC, 
                             see the .h files for both classes. PPM doesn't need this functionality. 
                           - When being asked by OP Config to save the value to some variable which the TCB does not recognize, the TCB used to respond with a
                             repeat command. Changed this to a response for next sentence (same as it would if it did recognize the variable), althought it does
                             set a flag in the response so OP Config will know. The most common cause for this issue to occur, as I discovered, is running a 
                             version of OP Config more recent than the firmware version on the TCB. In that case the user should re-flash but it's also probably
                             fine to just skip the unknown variable. 
                           - A good deal of changes to the sound class. OP_TBS is now a sub-class of OP_Sound, as is the new OP_SoundCard subclass which will
                             be used to communicate with a future Open Panzer sound card. Various other additional variables were created for the additional 
                             sounds that will be possible with the OP card, as well as new functions such as setting the volume with an analog trigger. 
00.90.21        01/03/2017 - Fixed a small bug with the smoker that only presented itself when manually enabled/disabled using a function trigger.
00.90.20        12/15/2016 - Add a Null_Motor drive type, which can be used when the user chooses to detach the turret stick controls 
                             from actually controlling the turret. 
00.90.19        12/05/2016 - A million things I didn't bother recording during development.
00.90.16	    4/12/2016  - Fixed debug LED behavior on braking. PCComm class can now try to initialize the radio after communication with 
                             PC has started, in the event the user forgets to turn their radio on until after, or communcation begins before
                             the sketch has a chance to set it up. Fixed machine gun LED pin number, was incorrect for current board. 
00.90.15        4/02/2016  - Added FlySky iBus support, up to 14 channels. Required board change to Rev 0.19. 
                             Tested with FlySky i10 transmitter and FS-iA10 and FS-iA6B receivers.
00.90.14        3/25/2016  - Local dev copy
00.90.13        3/25/2016  - Added printed function names in Debug dump
                           - RC Output pass-throughs can now be of type regular or Pan Servo
